## üß† Overview

STELLA.ai is an intelligent system that revolutionizes stroke detection and analysis through advanced AI technology. Our system automatically segments brain lesions using uploaded CT scans, harnessing the power of computer vision and machine learning to extract precise lesion segmentation points for both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.

The system is designed to assist medical professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses, particularly in resource-constrained healthcare settings. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and interactive visualization tools, STELLA.ai aims to improve stroke diagnosis outcomes and enhance medical education.
